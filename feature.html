    <div id="hdr">"Future School - Modern Teacher" by Albina Markaryan</div>
    <div id="feat">
        <p>It’s going without saying that new generation is constantly growing which means that it is always the time for change, especially in educational field. Have you ever imagined what qualities and mindset will have teachers of the future?</p>
        <p>The transition from subject-object relationships to subject-subject relationships will likely happen. Nowadays, youngsters often face with a particular problem—their opinion and point of view isn’t taken into account, owning to the fact that matured and more experienced people don’t take them seriously because of their youth. This vision is fundamentally wrong because older people have no idea with what life situations adolescents have come across. This experience offers them a special point of view which can help to analyze situations from a crooked angle. It is the reason why new teachers will change the methods of teaching based on their own experience. Thus, the students’ personalities and opinions will be taken into consideration. All things considered, it will help to make a comfortable and understanding atmosphere between teachers and students, therefore, young people will take more passion and satisfaction during the educational process.
            The teacher of the future is a contemporary of his students. New teachers will understand both students and parents because on one hand, they understand children’s worldview, their attitude to life, the ways how they tend to solve problems due to the fact that they had a similar experience. While on the other hand they also understand the young people’s parents since that with age they became less impulsive and can consider situations from both sides. And only they will help to resolve the conflict between parents and children. They are psychologists, sociologists, mentors, senior friends, assistants, tutors in one bottle. And in general, the teacher of the future is a universal person who loves his subject, values and respects students by offering them the most comfortable environment to study.</p>
        <p>All in all, the teacher of future is a flexible, understanding, unbiased person who follows the current trends and, simultaneously, is experienced, wise and intelligent during the educational process. This teacher can help students to broaden their horizons and give useful pieces of advice without judging. This teacher exactly, in our opinion, will be the embodiment of the future.</p>
