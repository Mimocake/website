    <div id="hdr">"Future School - Modern Teacher" by Vera Konovalova</div>
    <div id="feat">
        <p>Who is the FUTURE teacher? A robot, artificial intelligence or maybe a cyborg? The 
        topic of the future teacher is highly controversial, it has generated a lot of debates and 
        discussions nowadays. With the onset of the age of modern technology, people's lives 
        have radically changed. Should the teacher of the future keep up with these changes, 
        taking into account the modern views of schoolchildren or stay just conservative?</p>
        <p>The teacher of the future is a dedicated professional in his field, who loves his job. He 
        doesn't only impart his knowledge to the students, but also attracts students to search 
        some information via the Internet to enlarge these knowledges, teaches them to acquire 
        knowledge and necessarily use it on daily basis. The teacher of the future is the organizer 
        of the educational process.  To my mind, this skill is crucial today.</p>
        <p>Secondly, “Maria Ivanovna” in the future should be friends with the technical concepts, 
        gadgets, Internet and so on. After all, using of an interactive whiteboard or other 
        applications greatly simplifies and accelerates the educational process. Moreover, 
        capability of conducting distance lessons is a very important skill, which the teacher and 
        students will be rescued by in case of unforeseen circumstances. </p>
        Lastly, I suppose that the pedagogue of the future need to put up with modern outlook, 
        leave the comfort zone and accept the fact that the world is moving on, and we and our 
        views should change with the times.
        <p>As for my experience, fortunately, I have been taught by such teacher nearly 8 years. 
        Valeria Yurievna is one of the most modern teachers I have ever seen. Using Internet 
        resources when you look for any unknown words? No problem. Maybe, any Zoom 
        lessons under quarantine? You are welcome! Discussion of nowadays issues? Go ahead! 
        Wish there were more such sophisticated teachers as our teacher of English in 
        Interlingua.</p>
        <p>So, in conclusion, I want to note that the above is my humble opinion. But, to be honest, I 
        rest assured, a lot of students can sign under my words. </p>
